/**
 * Implementation notes:
 * 
 * 1. For a production environment, you would need to:
 *    - Set up a server running the DeBERTa model (using Python/Flask/FastAPI)
 *    - Deploy the model to a cloud service (AWS, GCP, Azure)
 *    - Create API endpoints that accept job data and return analysis
 * 
 * 2. The DeBERTa model would need to be:
 *    - Fine-tuned on job fraud data
 *    - Optimized for identifying India-specific job scams
 *    - Regularly updated with new fraud patterns
 * 
 * 3. To set up the Python backend with DeBERTa:
 *    - Install transformers, torch, flask
 *    - Load pretrained DeBERTa model
 *    - Create endpoints to analyze job text
 *    - Deploy to server with appropriate compute resources
 * 
 * 4. Migration plan:
 *    - First implement the Python/Flask backend with DeBERTa
 *    - Test the API independently
 *    - Then update this file to call the real API
 *    - Add a feature flag to switch between mock and real API
